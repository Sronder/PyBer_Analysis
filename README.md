## Summary of the Analysis

When taking these figures into account, there are a few things to consider. Do PyBer's  goals include increasing the amount of riders, drivers, or fares for either the suburban or rural markets? Included are recommendations based on these observations:

- Rural customers are paying the highest fares, however are the smallest market represented. With a discount for rides over a stipulated distance or specified destination (ie, doctor's office, grocery store, voting location), you could increase participation from the Rural customer base.

- To increase the amount of drivers in the Suburban and Rural markets, you may offer a gas stipend to offset the cost of gas and make this a more enticing employment opportunity. Having more drivers available in these markets may increase customer participation.

- Targeted advertising initiatives may help with increasing brand awareness for Rural and Suburban markets. Mail inserts, local school sponsorships, and brand activation events are direct ways to engage with these markets.

- This analysis does not take into account the current state of inflation and subsequent gas prices, which will directly effect the amount of income for all rural drivers.
